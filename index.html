    <h1>Help Faisal Get the Care He Desperately Needs</h1>
    <img src="faisal.jpg" width="50%"></img>

    <p><strong>Dear Friends and Kind Supporters,</strong></p>

    <p>We are reaching out to help our dear friend, Faisal. He is currently bedridden and in urgent need of professional caregiver support. Unfortunately, despite his critical condition, his insurance company does not provide adequate coverage for external caregivers which is needed as he is unable to move or communicate at this time.</p>

    <h2>The Urgent Need</h2>

    <p>Faisal requires round-the-clock assistance for basic daily needs, mobility support, and medical care. 
      His wife is doing this at this time in addition to working full time and taking care of two kids. However, 
      one person is not enough to take care of this. We need one external person who can help. 
      The cost of a caregiver is around $3,000 per month, and we are hoping to secure at least two years of care—a total of $72,000.</p>
    
    <p>Faisal is getting treatment via Health Insurance obtained thru his wife's work. However, his wife is also getting laid off from work at the end of April due to an acquisition. 
      This means, Faisal's family needs to pay insurance premiums via COBRA until she finds another job.
      </p>
      We want to provide this amount to his family so that they may use this fund as they see fit.


    <h2>How You Can Help</h2>

    <p>Any contribution, no matter how small, will go directly toward providing the care Faisal desperately needs. Your support will ensure that he receives dignified, professional assistance during this challenging time.</p>

    <h2>Background Information</h2>

    <p>Faisal completed his high school education from Barishal Cadet College in Bangladesh, where he excelled both academically and athletically. He later pursued his PhD in the United States and went on to teach at several universities, including the University of Houston. At Barishal Cadet College, he served as the 'Games Prefect,' a testament to his athleticism and leadership. Those who knew him remember him as a vibrant, energetic individual with a strong presence both in the classroom and on the field.</p>

    <p>Faisal is happily married and the proud father of two sons. However, his life took a dramatic turn when he was diagnosed with a brain tumor located in a highly sensitive area, making complete surgical removal impossible without risking severe nerve damage. Despite this, surgeons attempted operations at two different hospitals in successive years, and doctors explored experimental medications in hopes of slowing the tumor’s progression. Unfortunately, none of these efforts were successful in halting its growth.</p>

    <p>Over time, the tumor began pressing against critical nerves, leading to a gradual loss of functionality and mobility. Faisal is now unable to speak or move freely, though he remains mentally alert and can communicate through eye and finger movements.</p>

    <p>He has been hospitalized numerous times and continues to make frequent visits each month. However, due to insurance limitations, hospitals are only able to address his immediate symptoms before discharging him—unable to solve the underlying cause. At home, he does not receive the level of care he truly needs.</p>

    <p>His wife, who works full-time to support the family, does her utmost to care for him. Yet, given Faisal's physical condition and weight, assisting him with daily personal activities has become increasingly difficult for her to manage alone. In addition to caring for him, she must also provide for their children and keep the household running.</p>

    <p>This is why additional in-home support is so essential. Unfortunately, their current health insurance does not cover the cost of such care. Meanwhile, hospitals are unable to keep him for extended periods due to insurance constraints. The family is caught in a difficult situation where consistent, compassionate care at home is needed—but not covered.</p>
